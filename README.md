# flatmates_bill

**Description:** An application that will get an input for a bill amount for a particular period and the days that each flatmate has stayed in the house for that given period.  It will then return how much each flatmate owes (has to pay). Also, it will generate a PDF report with the flatmates name, period and how much each owes.
